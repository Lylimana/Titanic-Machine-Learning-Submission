This is my first ever README. 

Welcome to my submission for the titanic competition on kaggle. 

The project will include the use of ML models to determine whether an individual survived or perished from the data avaiilable from the titanic. 

This is also my first endeavour in documenting and presenting this information in a clear and concise way for people viewing my portfolio to look over. 

I hope you enjoy!
